//I know this is really badly done, but frankly I dont know any better, I was just having a bit of fun with this and seeing what I could
//Do with my very little previous experience, most of this I figured out how to do as I was doing it, I only really understood
//variables and things like that beforehand (also how to make buttons). That is why I implamented everything by buttons, so I did not
//Have to worry about spacing and things like that because I have no idea how to do that.
//I tried many other ideas using the <script> tag but none of them seemed to work well so I gave up and just did this
//Don't judge me too hardly at how messy I am sure this is.
